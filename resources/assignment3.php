Build an anonymous feedback application

In this assignment, you will build a very simple, minimal 'Anonymous feedback application'. 

Anyone can register in this app and get a 'Unique shareable link' to collect feedback from others. The user can see the given feedback on his/her Dashboard. 

Requirements: 
You should use the following HTML template for building the app. 
Implement the Registration and login functionality and show the dashboard only to the logged-in user. 
Using the 'Feedback form' link, anyone can share their feedback without logging into the app.
Use 'File' to store all kinds of data. Don't use a Database. 
Try to keep your code clean and follow the best practices. 
Feel free to ask if you have any confusion or questions about the assignment. 

Good luck! 🚀
